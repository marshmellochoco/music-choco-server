# music-choco-server

Aim of this project is to create a audio streaming application that is similar to Spotify Web Player (but not a total clone of it). I created this project just to test out my React skills and to learn more about fullstack development also maintaining and managing a project.

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisite

-   [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (or npm)
-   MongoDB (I'm using [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas))
-   My [music-choco](https://github.com/marshmellochoco/music-choco) or your own developed music player!

### Setting up development environment

```
git clone https://github.com/marshmellochoco/music-choco-server.git
cd music-choco-server && npm i
npm run dev
```

_Make sure the port is open (Default: 4000)_
