# react-music-player-server

Aim of this project is to create a audio streaming application that is similar to Spotify Web Player (but not a total clone of it). I created this project just to test out my React skills and to learn more about fullstack development also maintaining and managing a project.

## Getting Started
### Pre-requisite
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (or npm)
- MongoDB (I'm using [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas))
- My [react-music-player](https://github.com/marshmellochoco/react-music-player) or your own developed music player!

### Setting up development environment
```
git clone https://github.com/marshmellochoco/react-music-player-server.git
cd react-music-player && npm i
npm run start
```
